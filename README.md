# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Weather Forecast](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## API Problem:
- The API metaweather.com/api have problem with CORS.
- I can disable security Chrome (or other browsers) to develop the feature. However, I think CORS should be enabled on Server.
- So I changed to new library: api.openweathermap.org

## Technology
- React: React Hooks for Manage State
- UI: reactstrap
- CSS: CSS Module
- Unit Test: Jest + React Testing Library


## Todo List
1. Init source with Create Weather Forecast
2. Install necessary libraries
3. Structure for project
4. Build Containers
5. Build components - Unit Test
6. Build APIs and implement to container
7. Write unit test for container
8. Refactor code & UIs
